This repo provides mini-projects for [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1) course by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, Stephen Wong (Rice University).

*If you are currently enrolled in the course, you definitely __should not__ browse the code for mini-projects which you have not submitted yet.*

Mini-projects were created and can be run using [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) - a browser-based programming environment for the programming language Python. CodeSkulptor environment is the only one allowed for the class.
